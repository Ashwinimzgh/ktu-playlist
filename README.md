### Project Description
KTU PLAYLIST is a user-friendly website designed to help students and faculty members locate KTU lecture videos. Utilize the intuitive filtering system to browse videos by scheme, branch, and year.
This code implements a basic filtering and navigation system for a KTU Lectures & Videos website.
* Filtering:
   * Users can select the desired "Scheme," "Branch," and "Semester" using dropdown menus.
   * When the "Apply Filters" button is clicked, the code checks the selected values.
   * Based on the selected filter combination, the code dynamically redirects the user to a specific HTML page.
* Page Navigation:
   * Each unique combination of scheme, branch, and semester has a corresponding HTML page.
   * For example, "2019 Scheme," "EEE Branch," and "Semester 1" would link to "s1_eee_2019.html".
   * These pages can contain:
     * Lists of subjects for that specific combination.
     * Links to individual subject pages.
     * Links to videos, notes, or other relevant resources.
* Subject Pages:
   * Each subject page can further list modules or units within that subject.
   * Links to specific YouTube videos or other online resources can be provided for each module.
Key Features:
* Dynamic Redirects: The code dynamically redirects users to the appropriate page based on their filter selections.
* Flexible Filtering: Users can filter by scheme, branch, and semester, providing a customized experience.
* Organized Structure: The system provides a well-organized structure for accessing subject-specific content.
* User-Friendly: The code includes basic error handling and provides feedback to the user.
Further Enhancements:
* Database Integration: Integrate with a database to store and retrieve information about subjects, videos, and other resources.
* Search Functionality: Implement a search bar to allow users to quickly find specific content.
* Advanced Filtering: Add more advanced filtering options (e.g., keywords, instructors).
* User Authentication: Implement user authentication to allow users to save their preferences and access personalized content.
* Improved User Interface: Enhance the user interface with better visual design and interactive elements.
This implementation provides a foundational framework for a robust and user-friendly system for accessing and organizing KTU lecture and video resources.

### The Problem statement
Students and faculty at Kerala Technological University (KTU) often face challenges in accessing and organizing lecture videos.
* Scattered Resources: Lecture videos are often scattered across various platforms (like Google Drive, YouTube, university portals), making them difficult to find and access.
* Inefficient Search: Existing search methods are often inadequate, requiring users to manually sift through numerous files or rely on outdated links.
* Poor Organization: Lack of a centralized system leads to disorganized video libraries, making it challenging to locate specific lectures or courses.
* Time-Consuming: Finding relevant lecture videos can be a time-consuming process, hindering efficient learning and preparation. 

### The Solution
"KTU Playlist" aims to address these challenges by providing a user-friendly platform for accessing and organizing KTU lecture videos.
Key Features:
* Centralized Repository: A centralized platform to store and host KTU lecture videos from various sources.
* Intuitive Filtering System:
   * Filter videos by scheme (e.g., B.Tech, M.Tech, Ph.D.)
   * Filter by branch (e.g., Computer Science, Mechanical, Civil)
   * Filter by year (e.g., 1st year, 2nd year, etc.)
* Advanced Search Functionality:
   * Search by keywords (e.g., lecturer name, course name, topic)
   * Search by video title or description
* User-Friendly Interface:
   * Clean and intuitive design for easy navigation
   * Clear categorization and labeling of videos
   * Mobile-responsive design for access on various devices
* Community Features:
   * Allow users to rate and review videos
   * Enable users to share videos with classmates
   * Provide a forum for discussions and Q&A related to lectures
Benefits:
* Improved Accessibility: Easy access to lecture videos from any device with an internet connection.
* Enhanced Learning: Streamlined access to learning resources improves student engagement and understanding.
* Time-Saving: Efficient search and filtering capabilities save valuable time for both students and faculty.
* Improved Organization: Centralized platform ensures organized and easily accessible video libraries.
* Enhanced Collaboration: Community features foster collaboration and knowledge sharing among students.
